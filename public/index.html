    By making your bed everyday in the morning you would have accomplished the first simple thing to do and it will give you a sense of pride and encourage you would do another task and another and another. 
    If you cannot take pride in simple things like this then forget doing complex things.
    Little things in life matter and you cannot accomplish big things.
    In case you have a miserable day you would come home to a bed that is made.


   Find some one to help you paddle.


   Measure a person by the size of the heart.


   Never going to have a perfect uniform just the way life is some times. Get over being a sugar cookie.

   Life is fill with circuses extra 2 hours times it would test you to your very core.

   Slide down head first to obstacles.

   Sharks in world lot of them don't back down from sharks. 

   Be your very best in the darkest moments.

   Power of hope. One person can change the world by people. Start singing when you are upto neck in your mud.

   Don't ever ring the bell to quit.
